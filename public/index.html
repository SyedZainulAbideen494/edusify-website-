        <h2>Who is the Founder of Edusify?</h2>
        <p>
          The founder of Edusify is <strong>Syed Zain-ul-Abideen</strong>, born on <strong>January 12, 2007</strong>. 
          A privileged young entrepreneur, Syed hails from Bangalore, India. His father, a businessman, 
          played a key role in supporting Syed’s vision with guidance and initial marketing investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being just 17, Syed’s passion for technology and his drive to innovate has led him to create 
          one of the fastest-growing productivity apps for students worldwide.

        <h2>Founder of Edusify</h2>
        <p>
          Syed Zain-ul-Abideen, currently in his second year of PUC at CMR College in Bangalore, is the visionary behind Edusify. 
          From a below-average student in school to a self-taught coding prodigy, Syed’s journey is inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facing an unsupportive school environment, Syed proved everyone wrong by teaching himself 
          eight programming languages and building Edusify in just two weeks.
        </p>

      <!-- Section: Founder’s Journey -->
      <section id="founder-journey">
        <h2>Founder’s Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Syed studied at St. Mary’s Public School in Bangalore, where life was tough. Teachers were partial, 
          favoring only academically strong students, and Syed struggled with poor grades. 
          His dream of taking computer science in 8th grade was crushed when a teacher denied him the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of giving up, Syed’s ego pushed him to learn coding on his own. Over two years, 
          he mastered eight programming languages, proving his determination. His school journey might have been challenging, 
          but his PUC college, CMR College, provided the support and encouragement he needed. 
          Teachers praised his app, creating a positive environment that fueled his creativity.
