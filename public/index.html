        <h2>About the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          Edusify was created by <strong>Syed Zain-ul-Abideen</strong>, a 17-year-old student in his second year of PUC in Bangalore. Despite being an average student with no professional training in app development, Syed taught himself to code and built Edusify entirely on his own in just two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facing challenges like lack of support from his teachers, Syed relied on his passion for coding and the encouragement of his father, a businessman who provided initial marketing investment. Today, Edusify is a testament to his determination and innovation.
